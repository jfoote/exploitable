    of GDB have been issued. WARNING: This command may change the underlying

        This behavior is due to a bug in the Python API of earlier versions
        of GDB. In these versions, the results of the 'disassemble' command
        are always printed directly to GDB's STDOUT rather than optionally
        being suppressed and passed as a return value via the Python API.
