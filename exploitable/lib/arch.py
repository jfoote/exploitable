'''
A collection of Python objects that wrap and extend the GDB Python API based.

The objects in this file should generally not be instantiated directly--
they should be accessed via getTarget(), which selects the proper GDB wrapper
objects at runtime based on the architecture of the system executing the code.

Note that for many objects defined in this file, GDB is queried only when the
object is instantiated: if the state of the Inferior changes, any previously
created instances should be considered stale.
